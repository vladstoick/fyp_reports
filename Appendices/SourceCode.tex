\section{Grading library source code}

A good way to navigate the source code is to start in the assessor class defined in \texttt{lib/sql\_assess/assesor.rb}. The assessor is the public interface of the library.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|Y|Y|}
    \hline
    \textbf{File} & \textbf{Description} \\\hline
    \endhead
    \texttt{Gemfile} & Dependencies for library (no dependency listed here as dependencies for ruby gems are pulled from the gem spec) \\\hline
    \texttt{LICENSE.txt} & MIT License of repository \\\hline
    Rakefile & Defines the rake task of the library as the test spec. A rake task in Ruby is a command that can be executed. \\\hline
    \texttt{sql\_assess.gemspec} & Defines the proprieties of the gem: name, author, licence, and dependencies. \\\hline
    \texttt{Gemfile.lock} & Defines the versions of dependencies currently installed. When the library is installed it will use these versions. \\\hline
    \texttt{codecov.yml} & Configuration for codecov \\\hline
    \texttt{lib/sql\_assess.rb} & Defines the namespace of the library and includes all the main sub classes \\\hline
    \texttt{lib/sql\_assess/version.rb} & Defines the current version of the library \\\hline
    \texttt{lib/sql\_assess/assesor.rb} & Implementation of \texttt{Assesor} \\\hline
