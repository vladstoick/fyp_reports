\subsection{Unit testing}

An important testing tool in any application is represented by unit tests.
Unit testing refers to the testing of individual units of code or groups
of related units \citep{unit_testing}. The purpose of unit testing is to
make sure the code meets the specifications \citep{Olan2003}

Unit testing is especially important
in dynamic languages like Ruby where due to the lack of types, refactoring can
become more complicated as we can't be sure that the change of a single component
will not affect the other components as well. Testing increases the confidence
that an application will run as expected \citep{Olan2003}.

In order to unit
test the two parts of the application, we are using RSpec which is a DSL
testing tool for Ruby \citep{wiki:rspec}. Both parts of the application have a code
coverage of 100\%, which means that every line of code
is performed in the unit test suite.
