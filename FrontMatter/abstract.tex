This project aims to build an application that can automatize Standard Query Language (SQL) assignments. More specifically, the project will grade a students' \mintinline{mysql}{SELECT} queries compared to an instructor's \mintinline{mysql}{SELECT} query. In order to accurately provide a grade, the application will not only look at the results of each query, but also the components of each query, in order to provide a partial grade based on the differences. In order to do that, the project will make use of one important concept: canonicalizing - transforming the two queries to a standardized form in order to remove any syntactic or not relevant differences.

The end product will be a web application where teachers can create assignments and students and submit solutions to them. The application will be able to provide a partial grade and/or hints to students, in case they make errors.
