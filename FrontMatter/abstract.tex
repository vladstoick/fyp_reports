This project built an application that can automatize Standard Query Language (SQL) assignments. More specifically, the application grades a students' \mintinline{mysql}{SELECT} queries compared to an instructor's \mintinline{mysql}{SELECT} query. In order to accurately provide a grade, the application does not only look at the results of each query, but also the components of each query, in order to provide a partial grade based on the differences. To do that, the project makes use of one important concept: canonicalizing - transforming the two queries to a standardized form in order to remove any syntactic irrelevant differences.

The end product is a web application where teachers can create assignments and students can submit solutions to them. The application is able to provide a partial grade and hints to students, in case they make errors.
