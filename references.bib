  abstract = {The XData system, currently being developed at IIT Bombay, provides an automated and interactive platform for grading student SQL queries, as well as for learning SQL. Prior work on the XData system focused on generating query specific test cases to catch common errors in queries. These test cases are used to check whether the student queries are correct or not. For grading student assignments, it is usually not sufficient to just check if a query is correct: if the query is incorrect, partial marks may need to be given, depending on how close the query is to being correct. In this paper, we extend the XData system by adding features that enable awarding of partial marks to incorrect student queries. Our system is able to go beyond numerous syntactic features when comparing a student query with a correct query. These features of our grading system allow the grading of SQL queries to be fully automated, and scalable to even large class sizes such as those of MOOCs.},

@article{literature:assesql,
abstract = {Being able to formulate useful SQL queries is a fundamental skill required by many software development professionals. Mastering this skill is a difficult process, requiring considerable practice and effort on the part of the student. In addition, assessment of SQL query formulation skills is a process that does not appear to have been thoroughly researched, and numerous problems are inherent to the approaches commonly taken in universities to do this assessment. This paper examines two of these approaches, identifies problems with them, and then proposes another method of assessment. The way that students are assessed in a subject has a significant impact on their learning approach, and it is crucial that assessment tasks are carefully designed and implemented to inculcate a deep learning experience. The online assessment method proposed is described, evaluated, and the challenges and benefits of using it are discussed. This is a work-in-progress and the conclusion states that further validation is needed, and there is opportunity for additional research and development in this particular area of assessment.},

  abstract = {GOOD with numbers? Fascinated by data? The sound you hear is opportunity knocking. Mo Zhou was snapped up by I.B.M. last summer, as a freshly minted Yale M.B.A., to join the technology company's fast-growing ranks of data consultants. They help businesses make sense of an explosion of data — Web traffic and social network comments, as well as software and sensors that monitor shipments, suppliers and customers — to guide decisions, trim costs and lift sales. “I've always had a love of numbers,” says Ms. Zhou, whose job as a data analyst suits her skills. To exploit the data flood, America will need many more like her. A report last year by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, projected that the United States needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with “deep analytical” expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers, whether retrained or hired.},
