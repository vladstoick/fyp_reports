@article{literature:xdata,
  abstract = {The XData system, currently being developed at IIT Bombay, provides an automated and interactive platform for grading student SQL queries, as well as for learning SQL. Prior work on the XData system focused on generating query specific test cases to catch common errors in queries. These test cases are used to check whether the student queries are correct or not. For grading student assignments, it is usually not sufficient to just check if a query is correct: if the query is incorrect, partial marks may need to be given, depending on how close the query is to being correct. In this paper, we extend the XData system by adding features that enable awarding of partial marks to incorrect student queries. Our system is able to go beyond numerous syntactic features when comparing a student query with a correct query. These features of our grading system allow the grading of SQL queries to be fully automated, and scalable to even large class sizes such as those of MOOCs.},

@article{literature:assesql,
abstract = {Being able to formulate useful SQL queries is a fundamental skill required by many software development professionals. Mastering this skill is a difficult process, requiring considerable practice and effort on the part of the student. In addition, assessment of SQL query formulation skills is a process that does not appear to have been thoroughly researched, and numerous problems are inherent to the approaches commonly taken in universities to do this assessment. This paper examines two of these approaches, identifies problems with them, and then proposes another method of assessment. The way that students are assessed in a subject has a significant impact on their learning approach, and it is crucial that assessment tasks are carefully designed and implemented to inculcate a deep learning experience. The online assessment method proposed is described, evaluated, and the challenges and benefits of using it are discussed. This is a work-in-progress and the conclusion states that further validation is needed, and there is opportunity for additional research and development in this particular area of assessment.},

Mo Zhou was snapped up by I.B.M. last summer, as a freshly minted Yale M.B.A., to join the technology company's fast-growing ranks of data consultants. They help businesses make sense of an explosion of data — Web traffic and social network comments, as well as software and sensors that monitor shipments, suppliers and customers — to guide decisions, trim costs and lift sales. “I've always had a love of numbers,” says Ms. Zhou, whose job as a data analyst suits her skills. To exploit the data flood, America will need many more like her. A report last year by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, projected that the United States needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with “deep analytical” expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers, whether retrained or hired.},

Rails is a new approach to web-based application development that enables developers to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications using less code and less effort. Now programmers can get the job done right and still leave work on time. NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION: The book has been updated to take advantage of all the new Rails 1.2 features. The sample application uses migrations, Ajax, features a REST interface, and illustrates new Rails features. There are new chapters on migrations, active support, active record, and action controller (including the new resources-based routing). The Web 2.0 and Deployment chapters have been completely rewritten to reflect the latest thinking. Now you can learn which environments are best for your style application, and see how Capistrano makes managing your site simple. All the remaining chapters have been extensively updated. Finally, hundreds of comments from readers of the first edition have been incorporated, making this book simply the best available. Rails is a full-stack, open-source web framework that enables you to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications with a twist...you can create a full Rails application using less code than the setup XML you'd need just to configure some other frameworks. With this book, you'll learn how to use Rails Active Record to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. You'll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pagesusing easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, talk to web services, and interact dynamically with Javascript applications running in the browser (the "Ajax" architecture). You'll see how easy it is to deploy Rails. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all.},
