@article{literature:xdata,
  abstract = {The XData system, currently being developed at IIT Bombay, provides an automated and interactive platform for grading student SQL queries, as well as for learning SQL. Prior work on the XData system focused on generating query specific test cases to catch common errors in queries. These test cases are used to check whether the student queries are correct or not. For grading student assignments, it is usually not sufficient to just check if a query is correct: if the query is incorrect, partial marks may need to be given, depending on how close the query is to being correct. In this paper, we extend the XData system by adding features that enable awarding of partial marks to incorrect student queries. Our system is able to go beyond numerous syntactic features when comparing a student query with a correct query. These features of our grading system allow the grading of SQL queries to be fully automated, and scalable to even large class sizes such as those of MOOCs.},

abstract = {Being able to formulate useful SQL queries is a fundamental skill required by many software development professionals. Mastering this skill is a difficult process, requiring considerable practice and effort on the part of the student. In addition, assessment of SQL query formulation skills is a process that does not appear to have been thoroughly researched, and numerous problems are inherent to the approaches commonly taken in universities to do this assessment. This paper examines two of these approaches, identifies problems with them, and then proposes another method of assessment. The way that students are assessed in a subject has a significant impact on their learning approach, and it is crucial that assessment tasks are carefully designed and implemented to inculcate a deep learning experience. The online assessment method proposed is described, evaluated, and the challenges and benefits of using it are discussed. This is a work-in-progress and the conclusion states that further validation is needed, and there is opportunity for additional research and development in this particular area of assessment.},

Rails is a new approach to web-based application development that enables developers to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications using less code and less effort. Now programmers can get the job done right and still leave work on time. NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION: The book has been updated to take advantage of all the new Rails 1.2 features. The sample application uses migrations, Ajax, features a REST interface, and illustrates new Rails features. There are new chapters on migrations, active support, active record, and action controller (including the new resources-based routing). The Web 2.0 and Deployment chapters have been completely rewritten to reflect the latest thinking. Now you can learn which environments are best for your style application, and see how Capistrano makes managing your site simple. All the remaining chapters have been extensively updated. Finally, hundreds of comments from readers of the first edition have been incorporated, making this book simply the best available. Rails is a full-stack, open-source web framework that enables you to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications with a twist...you can create a full Rails application using less code than the setup XML you'd need just to configure some other frameworks. With this book, you'll learn how to use Rails Active Record to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. You'll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pagesusing easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, talk to web services, and interact dynamically with Javascript applications running in the browser (the "Ajax" architecture). You'll see how easy it is to deploy Rails. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all.},

Testing, the subject of this paper, is a widespread validation approach in industry, but it is still largely ad hoc, expensive, and unpredictably effective. Indeed, software testing is a broad term encompassing a variety of activities along the development cycle and beyond, aimed at different goals. Hence, software testing research faces a collection of challenges. A consistent roadmap of the most relevant challenges to be addressed is here proposed. In it, the starting point is constituted by some important past achievements, while the destination consists of four identified goals to which research ultimately tends, but which remain as unreachable as dreams. The routes from the achievements to the dreams are paved by the outstanding research challenges, which are discussed in the paper along with interesting ongoing work.},

@article{lit:xdata_d,
abstract = {Correctness of SQL queries is usually tested by executing the queries on one or more datasets. Erroneous queries are often the results of small changes, or mutations of the correct query. A mutation Q' of a query Q is killed by a dataset D if Q(D) {\$}\backslashneq{\$} Q'(D). Earlier work on the XData system showed how to generate datasets that kill all mutations in a class of mutations that included join type and comparison operation mutations. In this paper, we extend the XData data generation techniques to handle a wider variety of SQL queries and a much larger class of mutations. We have also built a system for grading SQL queries using the datasets generated by XData. We present a study of the effectiveness of the datasets generated by the extended XData approach, using a variety of queries including queries submitted by students as part of a database course. We show that the XData datasets outperform predefined datasets as well as manual grading done earlier by teaching assistants, while also avoiding the drudgery of manual correction. Thus, we believe that our techniques will be of great value to database course instructors and TAs, particularly to those of MOOCs. It will also be valuable to database application developers and testers for testing SQL queries.},

@article{lit:definining_success,
abstract = {Success is found relatively rare in the world of software projects. One possible reason may be the difference in the perception of the meaning of 'success' in the minds of people who evaluate the project performance. Usually, stakeholders external to the project organization use target cost and time for inferring 'project success' while those internal to project agree that the attainment of 'scope' of development decides the 'project success'. Hence, project success criteria, as believed by different groups of stakeholders, do not match. In this study, we examine the views of one such internal set of stakeholders: Programmer/Developers, Project Managers and Customer Account Managers. We conducted an exploratory survey to determine their view of a successful project. We found surprising uniformity in different constituents of this particular group of stakeholders and all of them overwhelmingly considered meeting the 'scope' of software projects, which comprises the functionality and quality of the project outcome, as the highest determinant of success. We believe that this view of software project success in the eyes of software professionals should be studied further to build a comprehensive project evaluation framework and should be utilized effectively to achieve success in terms of external objectives like customer satisfaction and customer happiness. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},
